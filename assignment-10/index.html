      "I wish to God I hadn't asked you here," he burst out.<br>

"What do you mean?" <br>

"When you're here, it's different, I'm happy. You've only to walk to the window, you've only to talk about liberty. When I saw you down there among them all..." He stopped short. <br>

"You thought how ordinary I was." <br>

"I tried to think so. But I thought you more wonderful than ever." <br>

An immense relief, and a reluctance to enjoy that relief, conflicted in her heart. <br>

She slid down into the chair. <br>

"I thought you disliked me," she said. <br>

"God knows I tried," he replied. "I've done my best to see you as you are, without any of this damned romantic nonsense. That was why I asked you here, and it's increased my folly. When you're gone I shall look out of that window and think of you. I shall waste the whole evening thinking of you. I shall waste my whole life, I believe".<br>

He spoke with such vehemence that her relief disappeared. She frowned and her tone changed to one almost of severity. <br>

"This is what I foretold. We shall gain nothing but unhappiness.  Look at me, Ralph." He looked at her.<br>

"I assure you that I'm far more ordinary than I appear. Beauty means nothing whatever. In fact, the most beautiful women are generally the most stupid. I'm not that, but I'm a matter-of-fact, prosaic, rather ordinary character; I order the dinner, I pay the bills, I do the accounts, I wind up the clock, and I never look at a book". <br>

"You forget..." he began, but she would not let him speak. <br>

"You come and see me among flowers and pictures, and think me mysterious, romantic, and all the rest of it. Being yourself very inexperienced and very emotional, you go home and invent a story about me, and now you can't separate me from the person you've imagined me to be. <br>

<span class="bold"> You call that, I suppose, being in love, as a matter of fact it's being in delusion. All romantic people are the same,"</span> she added.
