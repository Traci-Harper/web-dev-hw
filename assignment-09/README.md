13. A universal selector styles every element on the page. The element selector is used to select elements of a certain type. The class selector selects elements that serve the same function and the id selector calls the unique ID of an element. The universal and element selectors would be used to set the main styles for larger sections of the page. The class and id selectors would be used to style specific elements.

14. My color palette included gold, orange and brown because these were the most common colors used in design in the 1970's. Their hex codes are: #F1C40F, #F75C03 and #7A4419.


15. I chose the 1970s for my decade. I went and researched on Google for images and found a lot of great ones. I formatted the images with CSS, then I made the background gold. I changed the font to orange and the background of the divs to brown. I changed the top div so the brown background would show like a banner. I added sources at the bottom in a new div and formatted the css.
