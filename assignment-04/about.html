<h1>About Sylvia Plath</h1>
<p> Sylvia Plath (1932-1963) was an American poet and author. Showing a talent for poetry at a young age (she had a poem published when she was 8), Plath earned a scholarship to Smith College, where she wrote hundreds of poems and had her work published in national magazines.
Plaths style of poetry was known as confessional with her poems being deeply autobiographical and honest. </p>
