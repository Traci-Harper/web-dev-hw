15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I sketched my website layout. I picked colors for the site, I found image placeholders and dummy text. I followed along with the tutorial. I set up the html and then formatted the css. I added padding, margins and borders. Created a circle placeholder for a logo and a navigation bar with links, adding hover effects to each. I could not get the social links to work correctly, so I'll need to work on that later on.
