  <h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>
  Ah we can dance if we want to <br> we can leave your friends behind <br>
Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance <br>
Well they're are no friends of mine <br>
I say, we can go where we want to,<br> a place where they will never find <br>
And we can act like we come from out of this world <br>
Leave the real one far behind, <br>
And we can dance <br>
We can dance if we want to,<br> we can leave your friends behind <br>
Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance <br>
Well they're are no friends of mine <br>
I say, we can go where we want to a place where they will never find <br>
And we can act like we come from out of this world <br>
Leave the real one far behind <br>
And we can dance. <br>
Dance! <br>
Ah we can go when we want to the night is young and so am i <br>
And we can dress real neat from our hats to our feet <br>
And surprise 'em with the victory cry <br>
I say we can act if want to if we don't nobody will <br>
And you can act real rude and totally removed <br>
And i can act like an imbecile <br>
I say we can dance, we can dance everything out control <br>
We can dance, we can dance we're doing it wall to wall <br>
We can dance, we can dance everybody look at your hands <br>
We can dance, we can dance everybody takin' the chance <br>
Safety dance <br>
Oh well the safety dance <br>
Ah yes the safety dance <br>
Safety <br>
Safety-dance <br>
We can dance if we want to, we've got all your life and mine <br>
As long as we abuse it, never gonna lose it <br>
Everything'll work out right <br>
I say, we can dance if we want to we can leave your friends behind <br>
Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance <br>
Well they're are no friends of mine <br>
I say we can dance, we can dance everything out of control <br>
We can dance, we can dance we're doing it wall to wall <br>
We can dance, we can dance everybody look at your hands <br>
We can dance, we can dance everybody's takin' the chance <br>
Oh well the safety dance <br>
Ah yes the safety dance <br>
Oh well the safety dance <br>
Oh well the safety dance <br>
Oh yes the safety dance <br>
Oh the safety dance yeah <br>
Oh it's the safety dance <br>
It's the safety dance <br>
Well it's the safety dance <br>
Oh it's the safety dance <br>
Oh it's the safety dance <br>
Oh it's the safety dance <br>
Oh it's the safety dance <br>
