13. The id attribute is a unique identifier and each specific element should be different for each one. The class attribute is used to group similar types of elements together. The div element is block level and it creates a division on a new line. It's an easy way to wrap content that can be singular or nested. The span element is used to identify content that needs to appear visually unique on the page.
